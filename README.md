# TypeScript Discord Bot Template

This is a template for creating a discord bot with TypeScript.

You will need to create a ```.env``` file in the root directory containing the following
```
TOKEN=my-discord-bot-token
```

### Starting the Bot

To start the bot you should run the following three commands
```
npm run clean
npm run build
npm run start
```
This will clear the ```dist/``` directory, build, and start running the bot.
